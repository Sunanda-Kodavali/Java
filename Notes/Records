Record

It automatically creates constructors and getters for you

you can create constructon inside it but you need to call this(..) only

for Ex: Book class

public record Book(int ISBN, String title, String author, Category category) {

}

it means that this class a s a record has parameter constructor and getters and tostring equals hashcode methods

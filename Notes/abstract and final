abstract and final

you cannot create object for abstract class (but you can use ref of it for ex Parent Animal child dog

Animal animal = new Dog();

in this case you can use animal ref) but you can for final class
you need to implement methods in child class of which has parent abstract class, while final doesnt have to be extended

static and final literally similar
final and abstract completely opposite

Polymrphism: ability of showing object in diff forms
the method that is overriden should be in paren calss, then only polymorphism applies
for ex:

 List<Animal> pets = new ArrayList<>();
        pets.add(new Cat());
        pets.add(new Dog());
        pets.add(new Dog());
        pets.add(new Cat());

        for (Animal animal : pets) {
            animal.communicate();
        }
        
        
        now animal obj have access to dog and cat communicate overridden methods
        and it also have its own non overridden methods
        
        
        previously without polymorphism animal have access to animal methods only

Interface has only public abstract methods (good practice)
it allows method overloading
it allows instance variables but you need to intialize them (so dont use)

after java 9

interface allows default and static method implementations in interface

it achieves multiple inheritance

it is perfect ex of data abstraction: showing what is necessary

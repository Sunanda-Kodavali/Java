you have a case with Product parent and book and movie as childs

List<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();

        products.add(new Book(100L, 10, "The Immortals of Meluha", "Amish Tripati"));
        products.add(new Book(101L, 12,"The Secret of Nagas", "Amish Tripati"));
        products.add(new ChildrensBook(102L, 15,"The Secret of Nagas II", "Amish Tripati", "from 4 years"));
        products.add(new Movie(103L, 20, "Harry Potter", MovieGenre.DRAMA, "J. K. Rowling"));
        products.add(new Movie(104L, 30, "Kantara", MovieGenre.ACTION, "Rishabh shetty"));
        products.add(new Movie(105L, 25, "Our Planet", MovieGenre.DOCUMENTARY, "Keith Scholey and Huw Cordey"));
        products.add(new Product(106L, 40));

        for (Product product : products) {
            if (product instanceof Book book) {
                System.out.println(book);
            } else if (product instanceof Movie movie) {
                System.out.println(movie);
            }else {
                System.out.println("Its neither a Book nor a Movie");
            }
        }
        
        
        here you are checking product obj is which type of object using instanceof operator it returns true if it is of type book here
        
        you can not cast same level childs for ex: book and movie

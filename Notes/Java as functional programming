Functional Programming

a function should depend on itself

pue fn ex:

public int sum(int a, int b){
return a+b;
} 

a function should not depend externally


Lamda fn:

we can either store in a var or pas function as parameter

(params) -> body


functional interface:

a interface that has only one method is a functional interface


Streams:

are real functional programming
it has no side effects to the program
takes input and do cal and gives output


List<Movie> sortedMovies = myMovies.stream().sorted((o1, o2) -> o1.getTitle().compareTo(o2.getTitle()).toList();


here it doesnt effect myMovies list


.sorted
.filter
.map()---it changes one form into another   for ex: List<Movie> to List<String> (by getting moviename)
.forEach

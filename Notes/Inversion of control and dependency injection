Inverts the control

for ex:

collections.sort(list,comparator{
compareto
}

dependency injection is one form of ioc

here above we are injectiong method


we can inject object by passing object to constro while creating obj of class
or while aurowiring
or using setter method




for ex: we write cose in but seton action handle method
but it is called by framework. we cannot call handle method
...that is IOC



DI:

you can either set an interface in setter method
or spring autowired
or passing an interface in class constructor

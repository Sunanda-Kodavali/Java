Singleton:

An instance can only be created once.

public final class ClassSingleton {

    private static ClassSingleton INSTANCE;
    private String info = "Initial info class";
    
    private ClassSingleton() {        
    }
    
    public static synchronized ClassSingleton getInstance() {
        if(INSTANCE == null) {
            INSTANCE = new ClassSingleton();
        }
        
        return INSTANCE;
    }

    // getters and setters
}


static directly stores in memory

instance created once directly in memory

synchronized makes it threadsafe. allows to work with only one thread at a time.


Singletons tend to create messy code

you dont need this in spring boot, spring takes care of it with annotations

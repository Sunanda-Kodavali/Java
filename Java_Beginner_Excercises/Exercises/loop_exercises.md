## Exercise 1
### 5 numbers
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop.

## Exercise 2
### 5 numbers in a line
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 5 using a loop in a single line.
```
1 2 3 4 5
```
> **Bonus goal:**<br />
> Seperate the numbers with a comma
```
1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

## Exercise 3
### Multiples
Write a program that prints all the multiples of 3 from 1 to 30.
```
3 6 9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30
```
> **Bonus goal:**<br />
> Seperate the numbers with a comma

## Exercise 4
### Countdown
Write a program that prints the numbers from 10 to 1 using a loop
```
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1
```

## Exercise 5
### Tap Tap
Write a program that uses a loop to print the following
```
1 2 3 TAP! 4 5 6 TAP! 7 8 9 TAP! 10 11 12 TAP!
```

## Exercise 6
### Sum loop 1
Write a program that asks the user for a number `n` and prints the sum of the numbers `1` to `n`.

> **Example:**<br />
> User inputs `5`<br />
> Output:<br />
> `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`


## Exercise 7
### Sum loop 2
Modify `Sum loop 1` so that only multiples of three or five are considered in the sum.

> **Example:**<br />
> User inputs `17`<br />
> Output:<br />
> `3 + 5 + 6 + 9 + 10 + 12 + 15 = 60`


## Exercise 8
### Sum loop 3
Modify `Sum loop 1` so that the program asks the user for a number `n` and gives them the possibility to choose between computing the sum or computing the product of 1 to n.

## Exercise 9
### FizzBuzz
Write a program that counts and prints out from 1 to 100 on the screen.<br>
For each number that is a multiple of 3, print 'Fizz' instead of 3, for each number that is a multiple of 5, print 'Buzz' instead of 5, and for each number that is a multiple of both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz' instead.
```
1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz, ...
```

## Exercise 10
### Leap Years
Write a program that prints all the leap Years between 1900 and 2100.

## Exercise 11
### Fibonacci
Write a program that prints 20 numbers in the fibonacci sequence.
```
1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 ...

## Exercise 1
### Array elements 1
Write a program that calculates the sum of the first and last number of an array of numbers no matter the size of the array.
> **Example:**<br />
```
int[] numbers = { 2, 5, 10, 6, 3, 12, 20, 4, 15, 10 }
Result should be 12
```

## Exercise 2
### Array elements 2
Write a program that prints the value in the middle of the array.<br>
If the array has an even length you should print the sum of both numbers.
> **Example 1:**<br />
```
int[] numbers = { 12, 4, 2, 10, 17 }
Result should be 2
```
> **Example 2:**<br />
```
int[] numbers = { 2, 5, 10, 6, 3, 12 }
Result should be 16
```

## Exercise 3
### Print in reverse
Write a program that prints all the elements of an array in reverse.
> **Bonus goal:**<br />
> Write a function that reverses an array<br>
> The function should receive an array `int[]` as a parameter and return an array with the elements reversed.

## Exercise 4
### Fibonacci array
Write a program that calculates the first 20 numbes in the Fibonacci sequence and stores them in an array

## Exercise 5
Write a program that check wether a number exists inside an array of numbers.
```
int n = 5;
int[] numbers = {4, 7, 10, 12, 1, 8, 20};
// for this case the result would be false
```

## Exercise 6
Write a program that prints **1 per line** only the names on odd positions in an array of names.
```
String[] names = {“Josie”, “Cathrin”, “Bob”, “Max”, “Hannah”, “Alex”};
```

## Exercise 7
Write a program that prints the name with more characters in an array of names.

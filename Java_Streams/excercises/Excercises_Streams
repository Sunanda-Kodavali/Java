Exercise 1: Basic Stream Operations
Objective: Familiarize yourself with basic stream operations like filter, map, and forEach.
Create a list of integers from 1 to 20.
Use a stream to filter out even numbers.
Use a stream to square each number in the list.
Print each squared number using forEach.


Exercise 2: Stream with Custom Objects
Objective: Learn how to use streams with custom objects and perform operations like filter, map, and collect.
Create a class Person with fields name and age.
Create a list of Person objects.
Use a stream to filter out people who are younger than 18.
Use a stream to extract the names of all people.
Collect these names into a list and print them.



Exercise 3: Reduce Operation
Objective: Understand the reduce operation to perform aggregation tasks.
Create a list of integers.
Use the reduce method to find the sum of all integers in the list.
Use the reduce method to find the product of all integers in the list.



Exercise 4: Stream Pipelines and Performance
Objective: Understand the performance benefits of lazy evaluation in stream pipelines.
Create a list of integers from 1 to 10,000.
Use a stream to:
Filter out all numbers that are multiples of 3.
Map each remaining number to its square root.
Limit the result to the first 10 elements.
Print the resulting elements and measure the time taken to perform the operations.
